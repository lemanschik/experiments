# Typescript Partial Unlicensed

## Features
This is a Recode of Typescript from Scratch while it at present depends on the original Microsoft Typescript which is MIT Licensed because of NodeJS
This Implements The Typescript Syntax support for the Stealify Lang which is under the Unlicense all parts coded from our side are Unlicensed
while all used parts keep the original license till they are replaced. Via Inner Out Composition Pattern incremental applyed. We Encapsulate from
the Outside and then partial turn the inner code parts out but from scratch rewritten using newst supported Features.

eg: 
- No CJS Build, 
- Added Support for Desktop Extensions 
- multiple extension hosts as also made it fast hack able via Functional Programming. 
- replaces the typescript cli tools with lsp based once that can verify typescript syntax even from none typescript files and even partial.
